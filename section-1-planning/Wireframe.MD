## Purpose

Wireframing is to get a basic visual guide on the layout and potential interactivity or information on each page of the site. The wireframe comes after the sitemap. 

## Iterating

One of the core ideas behind wireframing is fast prototyping of potential layouts and element positioning so keeping the fidelity extremely low is key. 

This is usually accomplished with low effort design tools. Pen and paper, whiteboard, drawing boxes in a drawing program or some sites provide pre-built drag and drop objects to build them with. This allows fast changing and re-arranging of the wireframe without getting hung up on color, details or even accurate data. The main purpose is to explore and revise until the desired visual guide is achieved.

### Next Step

Usually we move on to mock-ups where a rough to full details mockups are created to give a preview of what the finish site will actually look like.
